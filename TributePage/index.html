      <h3>Introduction</h3> 

      <p>Benjamin Franklin is known for his experiments with electricity, as one of the Founding Fathers and as the man on the $100 bill.  However, the above “achievements” are not enough to demonstrate the breadth of intellect and wisdom Franklin acquired throughout his life.</p> 

      <h3>Discussion</h3> 

      <p>Franklin was born on January 17th 1706 in Boston Massachusetts.<sup>1</sup> Due to him being an avid reader since a very young age, his father intended for him to lead the life of a clergyman. However, the family’s finances were insufficient for Franklin to receive the necessary education and as a result it was cut short.  Eventually he joined his brother’s newspaper printing business where he acquired skills and personality traits that lead to much of his later success.  After working there since he was twelve and serving as the paper’s editor at sixteen he decided to leave Boston after he had a falling out with his brother.<sup>2</sup></p> 

      <p>He ended up in Philadelphia where he quickly procured a job as a printer.  After being promised letters of recommendation and credit by the governor of Pennsylvania, Franklin travelled to London in 1724 to buy the necessary tools for a new printing business. When the promises of the governor turned out to be empty, Franklin returned to Philadelphia in 1726.<sup>3</sup></p> 

      <p>By 1730 Franklin was married and the owner of a printing business.  He was the publisher of the widely read Pennsylvania Gazette and Poor Richard’s Almanack.  It was his successful business along with his habit for thrift and industry that helped him amass a fortune.  As a result of that he retired at 42 with the intention of pursuing his scientific interests.<sup>4</sup></p> 

      <p>He applied himself in a wide-range of scientific pursuits.  His interest in electricity led to him making important discoveries in the field such as the electrical properties of lightning and the invention of the lightning rod.  His interests extended to optics where he invented bifocal spectacles and music with the invention of the glass harmonica among others.<sup>5</sup></p> 

      <p>However most of his later life was devoted to civil service.  He was responsible for numerous improvements for the city of Philadelphia, such as the organizing of a Fire Union, the first subscription library, the paving and lighting of the roads and the founding of the university of Pennsylvania to name a few.</p> 

      <p>Eventually he was chosen to represent the assembly of Pennsylvania to London where he spent the better part of two decades.  He returned to Philadelphia where he was involved in the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and was soon after sent to France as the representative of the united colonies.  He succeeded in procuring French aid and cementing the alliance between the two countries with the Treaty of Paris. </p>

      <p>Upon his return from Paris he was elected as a delegate for Pennsylvania and took part in supporting and signing the US Constitution.  He died in April 17 1790.<sup>6</sup></p> 

      <h3>Epilogue</h3> 

      <p>Benjamin Franklin, a man with no official schooling managed to rise above poverty through constant application of his talents and of the lessons contained in books written by historical figures of the past. Through that practice he either intentionally or unintentionally groomed himself to become a person who played a major part in the events that led to the founding of a nation.   In Franklin one can find the persona of an exemplary civil servant, a distinguished scientist and a wise man.</p>
